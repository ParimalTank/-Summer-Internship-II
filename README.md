# Simulation Web Application

- Simulation app is a cloud-based CAD repair, surface, and volume mesh generation software as a service (SaaS) application. Our solution will help stitch gaps, fill holes, remove self-intersection, and automatically build watertight surface and volume mesh.

- It is a simple 3 steps process.

Upload the model 
Run meshing job.
Download and/or visualize the generated result.
